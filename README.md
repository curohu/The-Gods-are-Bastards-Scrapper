# ABOUT
This is a web scrapper and ePub writer for the web series "The Gods are Bastards". I created this as I prefer to read on an e-ink reader when possible.

The logic is loosely based on a similar scrapper for "A Practical Guide to Evil" [HERE](https://github.com/GabbyNEW/APGtE_Scraper)

# USAGE

This is setup to use the included dev container to build the environment which is designed to auto-build within VSCode. See the documentation [HERE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

## Requirements

- Written for Python 3.11.2.
- See [.devcontainer/requirements.txt](.devcontainer/requirements.txt) for list of required packages.

## Manual run steps

1. Build the Dev container or manually install Python 3.11+ and the required packages
2. Run the `scrapper.py` file with `python scrapper.py`. This will output an ePub.
